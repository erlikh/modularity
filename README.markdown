Documentation: http://kevgo.github.com/modularity

The folder "demos" contains fully functional example modules to play with. They are described in http://kevgo.github.com/modularity.

The folder "javascripts" contains the Modularity framework as well as utility files for the Closure compiler.

The file "Rakefile" contains sample jobs to run the JS compiler. In this case, it just compiles the demos.
Use this as a starting point for your own compiler jobs.

The folder "spec" contains unit tests for the Modularity framework.

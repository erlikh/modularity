Demo files to play with Modularity.

The folder demo_1 contains the basic module example from http://kevgo.github.com/modularity.
The folder demo_2 contains the composite module example from http://kevgo.github.com/modularity.

In each folder is a file "uncompressed.html", which loads the source files. This is useful for development mode.
You can modify the JS files and reload the browser window without having to recompile everything.

The file "compressed.html" does the same thing, only with the compiled JS in production mode. 
Don't forget to run "rake compile_demo" before refreshing this page.

The Javascript files are in the folders "src", just to move them a little out of the way.
